# Self-Driving Vehicle Control

In this project, I write and implement a controller for the CARLA simulator. The goal is to control the vehicle to follow a race track by navigating through preset waypoints. The vehicle needs to reach these waypoints at certain desired speeds, so both longitudinal and lateral control will be required.
