# Implementing motion planner in Carla to avoid both static and dynamic obstacles

The goal of this project will be to have a functional motion planning stack that can avoid both static and dynamic obstacles while tracking the center line of a lane, while also handling stop signs. To accomplish this, we will have to implement behavioral planning logic, as well as static collision checking, path selection, and velocity profile generation.
